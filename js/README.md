### This application is a messenger, I did it as I completed "The Great Frontend Marathon" course.

Its functionality has not been fully implemented, as I took several courses and did not have time to complete all the features in this application.

The application was intended as a messenger for communication between marathon students.

The creator of the marathon has made a backend and a server to which all requests were sent and we received a token for authorization under our name in the application.

##### Without this backend, the functionality does not work.
